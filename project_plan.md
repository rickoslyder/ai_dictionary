# Project Plan: AI-Powered Dictionary Extension

## 1. Overview

**Project Name**:  
AI Dictionary+

**Objective**:  
Create a browser extension that provides context-aware, AI-generated explanations of highlighted text. The extension should offer:
1. Quick pop-up summaries for single terms or phrases.  
2. A short, interactive prompt for refining the explanation.  
3. A “Continue in Chat” option to open a dedicated tab for a deeper conversation.  

**Key Benefits**:
- In-line, dynamic definitions and context for unfamiliar terms.  
- Reduced friction when researching or learning new concepts.  
- Seamless pivot from quick tooltip summaries to a full-blown AI discussion.

## 2. Scope & Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements
1. **Text Highlight + Tooltip**  
   - Detect user text selection on any webpage.  
   - Display an “Explain” button near the selected text.

2. **Context-Aware Explanation**  
   - Send the highlighted text to an AI language model (LLM) for a concise explanation or summary.  
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., short strings, punctuation, non-English text).

3. **Interactive Follow-Up**  
   - Within the tooltip, provide a small text input for refining or expanding the explanation.  
   - Summaries should update with subsequent prompts, maintaining conversation context (within reason).

4. **Open Full Chat**  
   - A button to open a new tab (or side panel) with a more robust chat interface.  
   - Preserve conversation history from the tooltip so the user can pick up where they left off.

5. **Configuration & Settings**  
   - Provide an extension options page for customizing:  
     - LLM API key or endpoint.  
     - Theme (light/dark) or auto-detect.  
     - Basic usage thresholds (token limits, etc.).

6. **Performance & Reliability**  
   - Cache responses for repeated queries.  
   - Handle rate limiting from the LLM API gracefully (e.g., queue requests or provide user feedback).

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Target latest Chrome, with a path to support Edge and Firefox.  
- **Security & Privacy**: Inform users that highlighted text is sent to an external AI service; use HTTPS at all times.  
- **Scalability**: The architecture should allow for easy switch to different LLM providers.  
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of content scripts, background scripts, and UI components.

### 2.3 Out of Scope
- **Offline Functionality**: No requirement to store large models locally.  
- **Proprietary Domain Knowledge**: Rely on general-purpose LLMs, not specialized training.  
- **Mobile Browsers**: Focus on desktop browsers first.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

```
┌────────────────┐      ┌────────────────────────┐
│ Browser Window │◄─►   │  Content Script (UI)   │
└────────────────┘      └────────────────────────┘
          |                       │
          | (send request)       │ (captures selection)
          ▼                       │
 ┌────────────────────────┐       │
 │ Background Service (SW)│◄─────┘
 │  - Orchestrates LLM    │
 │  - Manages caching     │
 └────────────────────────┘
          │ (API call)
          ▼
  ┌────────────────────────┐
  │  LLM API (OpenAI etc.) │
  └────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Content Script**  
   - Injects UI elements (tooltip, buttons) into the webpage.  
   - Captures the highlighted text and user input.  
   - Sends messages to the background script.

2. **Background Service Worker**  
   - Receives requests from the content script.  
   - Calls the LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or other).  
   - Applies any caching or rate-limiting logic.  
   - Responds with the LLM’s summary.

3. **LLM API**  
   - The external service providing AI-based responses.  
   - Must handle large language model requests efficiently.

4. **Extension Options Page**  
   - Allows configuration of API key, usage settings, etc.

5. **Full Chat Page**  
   - Launched when the user clicks “Open Chat.”  
   - Maintains conversation context.  
   - Built as a simple HTML/JavaScript page or a React app.

## 4. Technical Details

### 4.1 Tech Stack
- **Browser Extension**:  
  - Manifest V3 (Chrome-compatible).
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with or without a lightweight framework like Preact/React for UI).
- **LLM Integration**:  
  - Gemini's 2.0 Flash (`gemini-2.0-flash`) via REST API. You must use this model, do NOT use other Gemini models.
  - Perplexity's Sonar (`sonar`) via REST API. You must use this model unless specifically requested to do otherwise.
  - Could also integrate other LLM providers if needed.

Example Gemini cURL call:
```
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=$USER_API_KEY" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-X POST \
-d '{
  "contents": [{
    "parts":[{"text": "Explain how AI works"}]
    }]
   }'
```

Example Perplexity cURL call:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "model": "sonar",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Be precise and concise."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How many stars are there in our galaxy?"
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 123,
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "top_p": 0.9,
  "search_domain_filter": null,
  "return_images": false,
  "return_related_questions": false,
  "search_recency_filter": "<string>",
  "top_k": 0,
  "stream": false,
  "presence_penalty": 0,
  "frequency_penalty": 1,
  "response_format": null
}'
```

### 4.2 Data Flow
1. **User Highlights Text** → Triggers tooltip UI.  
2. **Request Summary** → Content script → Background script → LLM API.  
3. **LLM Response** → Background script → Content script → Tooltip UI.  
4. **User Requests Follow-Up** → Additional prompts stored in local state or extension storage → Re-sent to LLM with short conversation context.  
5. **User Opens Full Chat** → New tab with conversation history appended.

### 4.3 Caching Strategy
- Use a simple key-value store in `chrome.storage.local` or memory to cache queries.  
- Key = selected text (or hashed text); Value = the returned summary.  
- Cache invalidation policy to prevent stale data (e.g., 24-hour expiry).

### 4.4 Rate Limiting
- If using OpenAI, watch for 429 errors or usage caps.  
- Implement a queue system or exponential backoff to handle bursts.

### 4.5 Security
- Only transmit minimal necessary data (the user’s query) over HTTPS to the LLM API.  
- Provide a clear disclaimer about sending user-selected text to an external API.  
- Store API keys securely in extension settings, with minimal read/write access.

# Final Notes

With this plan, the development team has a clear path: build a Manifest V3 extension that captures highlighted text, requests an AI-generated explanation, and presents it via an unobtrusive UI. The extension should handle multi-turn conversations in a lightweight popup, with the option to pivot to a full-page chat. Once the core functionality is stable, further improvements—like caching, advanced settings, and cross-browser support—can be layered in.
