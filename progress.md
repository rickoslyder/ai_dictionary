### Chat Functionality Improvements

Fixed the chat functionality to properly submit messages and maintain context:

1. **Message Handling**: Updated the CustomChatThread component to correctly handle message submission using ComposerPrimitive components.

2. **Context Transfer**: Improved the way context is passed from the popup and content script to the chat page using URL parameters.

3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in the ChatProvider component with better logging and user feedback.

4. **Message Format Conversion**: Added proper conversion between different message formats to ensure compatibility with the Assistant UI components.

These changes make the chat interface fully functional, allowing users to submit messages and see responses in real-time with proper context from the extension.

### Fixed Chat UI Component Rendering Issues

Resolved critical errors in the chat UI rendering that were causing React component nesting errors and context-related crashes:

1. **Message Rendering**: Replaced the problematic `ThreadPrimitive.Messages` implementation with a custom message rendering approach that directly maps through messages and applies appropriate styling based on message roles.

2. **Button Nesting Issue**: Fixed a DOM nesting error where a button was incorrectly nested inside another button in the scroll-to-bottom component by using a div with appropriate cursor styling instead.

3. **Component Structure**: Simplified the component architecture to avoid context errors that were occurring with MessagePrimitive components not being used within their required provider context.

4. **Styling Improvements**: Enhanced the message display with better alignment (user messages right-aligned, assistant messages left-aligned) and consistent styling for improved readability.

These changes completely resolve the React errors that were appearing in the console and create a more stable and reliable chat interface.

### Fixed Message Submission Functionality

Completely replaced the chat message submission system with a simplified approach that directly integrates with our backend:

1. **Direct API Integration**: Removed dependency on Assistant UI's complex runtime system for message submission, replacing it with direct Chrome message passing to our background script.

2. **Improved State Management**: Added loading indicators and local state management to provide a more seamless user experience.

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implemented proper error handling for message submission and response processing.

4. **Auto-scrolling**: Added automatic scrolling to keep the latest messages in view.

5. **Visual Feedback**: Implemented loading animations to indicate when the AI is generating a response.

These changes make the chat interface fully functional, allowing users to send messages and receive responses from the AI model while maintaining the chat history and context.

### Enhanced Gemini API Context and Settings

Improved the Gemini API integration to provide richer context and better response quality:

1. **Enhanced Context System**: Added system prompts that provide the AI with contextual information about the user's current content and the extension's purpose, resulting in more relevant and helpful responses.

2. **Role Mapping**: Improved role mapping between our internal message format and the Gemini API format to properly handle system, user, and assistant messages.

3. **Increased Token Limits**: Updated the default token limit from 1000 to 2000 and increased the maximum configurable token limit from 2000 to 4000, allowing for more detailed responses when needed.

4. **Better API Configuration**: Enhanced the Gemini API request configuration with additional parameters like topP and topK for improved response quality.

5. **Improved Context Gathering**: Significantly enhanced the `getContextText` function to capture twice as much relevant context from web pages by:
   - Expanding the DOM element selectors to include more types of elements (article, section)
   - Doubling the character limit from 500 to 1000 characters
   - Adding intelligent parent element context selection
   - Adding error handling with graceful fallback to selected text

These enhancements take better advantage of Gemini Flash 2.0's capabilities by providing richer context while respecting user settings and maintaining efficiency.

### UI and Prompt Improvements

Enhanced the user experience and explanation quality with targeted improvements:

1. **Copy to Clipboard Button**: Added a convenient copy button to explanation tooltips, allowing users to easily copy explanations to the clipboard with a single click. The button provides visual feedback with a "Copied!" tooltip when clicked.

2. **Refined System Prompts**: Updated the system prompts sent to the Gemini API with explicit instructions to ignore CSS styling information unless specifically asked about it. This ensures that explanations focus on the core concepts rather than the styling or formatting of webpages.

3. **Enhanced Context Processing**: Improved how the application packages and processes context for the AI model, ensuring more relevant explanations by focusing on the semantic meaning of selected text rather than its presentation.

4. **Regenerate Button**: Added a new "Regenerate" button that allows users to request a fresh explanation that bypasses the cache. This is particularly useful when testing the effects of system prompt changes on previously cached explanations or when the initial explanation wasn't satisfactory.

5. **Fixed Markdown Rendering in Chat**: Implemented proper markdown rendering in the chat interface to match the tooltip experience. Added comprehensive styling for markdown elements to ensure code blocks, lists, and other formatting renders correctly in both light and dark themes.

These improvements make the extension more user-friendly while providing more focused and relevant explanations of selected text.
